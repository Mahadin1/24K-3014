Ask the user For n and Nth number

CALCULATE divisor = n/Nth
CALCULATE odd_even = n/2

IF "divisor" is in Non-decimal than Set "divisor" = Nth is a divisor of n
IF "divisor" is in decimal than Set "divisor" = Nth is not a divisor of n 

IF "odd_even" is in Non-decimal than SET "odd_even" = Even
IF "odd_even" is in decimal than SET "odd_even" = Odd
